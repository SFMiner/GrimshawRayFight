; A self contained game session.  One GameSession represents a
; complete match for a group of players.  The GameServer will spawn
; multiple instances of this scene when more than one game is
; required to accommodate all connected players.
;
; The root node holds references to the session manager script.  It
; contains child nodes for the map, players, Alaska (the NPC to
; rescue), Dr. Grimshaw and a container for power‑ups.
